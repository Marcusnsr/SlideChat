# SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding (CVPR2025)

[üçé **Homepage**](https://uni-medical.github.io/SlideChat.github.io/) | [ü§ó **Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/General-Medical-AI/SlideChat) | [ü§ó **Model**](https://huggingface.co/General-Medical-AI/SlideChat_Weight) | [üìñ**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11761v1) 

**Abstract**: Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patchlevel analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instructionfollowing dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat‚Äôs capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks.

# Update

- **üöÄ[2025-03-18]: We have released SlideInstruction, SlideBench and SlideChat!**
- **üöÄ[2025-02-27]: Accepted by CVPR2025!üåü**

# Release

We release **SlideChat**, **SlideInstruction**, and **SlideBench** as open-source resources, hoping to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.
- **SlideChat**: The first large vision-language assistant for whole-slide pathology image analysis, capable of generating comprehensive descriptions and contextually relevant responses.
- **SlideInstruction**: The largest comprehensive WSI instruction-following dataset, derived from pathology reports..
- **SlideBench**: A WSI multimodal benchmark including SlideBench-Caption, SlideBench-VQA-TCGA, and SlideBench-VQA-BCNB.
Before open‚Äësourcing, SlideBench‚ÄëVQA‚ÄëTCGA underwent a second round of expert review with pathologists, further enhancing data quality. The initial version covers 10 cancer types with 1,494 samples (SlideBench‚ÄëVQA‚ÄëTCGA.csv). **We later expanded it to 31 additional cancer types, rigorously validated by experts, yielding 3,176 samples (SlideBench‚ÄëVQA‚ÄëTCGA‚Äëplus.csv).** SlideChat achieved an accuracy of 75.23% on the initial version and 74.12% on the expanded version.

# Usage

This project is built upon [**Xtuner**](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner). To get started:

```bash
conda create --name xtuner-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate xtuner-env
git clone https://github.com/uni-medical/SlideChat.git
cd SlideChat
pip install -e .
```

## Pre-requisites

Download the JSON file containing WSI IDs (TCGA) and conversation data from the [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/General-Medical-AI/SlideChat). The input image file is in CSV format and contains 512-dimensional feature representations for all patches within the WSI. Example files are provided in the ./dataset/ folder. For slide downloading and processing, please refer to [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) and [DSMIL](https://github.com/binli123/dsmil-wsi).

## Training

SlideChat serializes each input WSI into a sequence of patches, converting each into visual embeddings with a patch-level encoder [CONCH](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CONCH). A slide-level encoder then interacts with these features to generate contextual embeddings. Then, a multimodal projector maps the visual features from the slide-level encoder into a unified space, aligned seamlessly with the LLM. SlideChat was trained for two stages: (1) Cross-Domain Alignment: SlideChat is trained to generate descriptive captions using 4.2K WSI-caption pairs from SlideInstruction. Specifically, only the slide-level encoder and projection are updated, while the patch-level encoder and LLM weights remain fixed; (2) Visual Instruction Learning: we utilize 176K WSI VQAs from SlideInstruction, allowing the slide encoder, projection layer, and large language model components to be fully trainable to ensure comprehensive adaptability.
